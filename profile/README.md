## Why Do We Have A Separate Github Org For the Razroo Community?

Razroo Community members contribute across multiple Cloud providers and many 3rd party platforms. By having this isolated Razroo Community Github org, we can have GitHub secrets, and environment variables that are shared across all community members to allow all contributions to be baked directly into the CI/CD. This enables community contributions to have their own production-grade isolated environment they can test in real-time.
