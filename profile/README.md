## Razroo Community ðŸ‘‹

Official GitHub Organization for Razroo Community members. Join us as we fulfill our mission of Human Collective Intelligence. Allow people to upload data seamlessly + integrate automatically. Enable humanity to share perfect quality/knowledge en masse. Read more about Human Collective Intelligence here: https://blog.razroo.com/razroo-mission-statement.  

## Why Do We Have A Separate Github Org For the Razroo Community?

Razroo Community members contribute across multiple Cloud providers and many 3rd party platforms. By having this isolated Razroo Community Github org, we can have GitHub secrets, and environment variables that are shared across all community members to allow all contributions to be baked directly into the CI/CD. This enables community contributions to have their own production-grade isolated environment they can test in real-time. 

## What Sort Of Code/Codebases Are Contributed To The Razroo Community? 

In general, it's a mirror of the Razroo Community codebases/frameworks located here: https://razroo.com/finder. Open source still lives over at github.com/razroo.com

Community members are also welcome to use this space to experiment with whatever. We plan on creating a Razroo Labs, or something along those lines for open source soon.
